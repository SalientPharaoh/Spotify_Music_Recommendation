# Spotify_Music_Recommendation
Music recommendation system based on songs liked by user using python

### HOW DOES IT WORK?
The project uses python as main programming language to perform the predictive analysis. I have used python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, etc to implement the system. The dataset on which the processing is done is taken from kaggle. The statistical methods are applied on the data to obtain similarity between the song entered as input and other songs present in the dataset. Top 5 songs with highest similarity are then shown as the recommended songs.

### LIBRARIES USED
The project used the following libraries:-
 * `pandas` : To manipulate and process the data.
 * `NumPy` : For statistical calculations and as dependency for other libraries used.
 * `matplotlib` : Perform data visualization to understand the data and trends indicated by the data.
 * `scikit` : For performing vector analysis and cosine similarity.
  
### FUTURE SCOPE
Further developments are to be done for this project. The updates include :-
* Creating a Full Stack website to access the recommendation engine online.
* Developing an application and integrating it with any music player to view the recommendations as well as play it in desired music platform.
* Adding additional features to system including trending songs across the globe and trending songs in particular region.
* Adding Genre wise, Artist wise and year wise filtering and recommendations.
* Adding sentiment Analysis for better music recommendation.
